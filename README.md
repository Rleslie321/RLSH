The minishell is a project from my Unix class. It involved making a program that was a very simplified version of bash or shell terminal. It execs programs, does shell expansion, pipelining, redirection, has builtin library calls and more. How to use:

Type "make" on the commandline to compile the necessary files.
Type "./msh" or "./msh filename.extension" to run program with or without files.
Type "exit" to exit the program.
Type "make clean" outside of the program to remove excess files from directory.
